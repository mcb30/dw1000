/*
 * Device Tree Overlay for Raspberry Pi IEEE 802.15.4 Tail board
 *
 * This board comprises a DecaWave DWM1000 module (containing a
 * DecaWave ScenSor DW1000 IC), providing an IEEE 802.15.4 compliant
 * Ultra-Wide Band (UWB) wireless transceiver.
 *
 * The DW1000 is connected via the SPI0 interface on the Pi, with the
 * chip select connected to CE0 and an IRQ connected via GPIO 25.
 *
 * This device tree overlay is intended to be embedded within a Pi Hat
 * ID EEPROM, allowing the board to be autodetected by sufficiently
 * recent kernels.
 *
